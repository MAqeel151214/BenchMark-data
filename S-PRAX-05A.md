# Session S-PRAX-05A — Business Strategy & Game-Theoretic Decisions (Part A)

> **Session ID:** `S-PRAX-05A`
> **Category:** `PRAXIS`
> **Subcategory:** `Business Strategy — Competitive Analysis, Pricing, Market Entry, Negotiation`

## Your Role

You are an elite benchmark designer for the **TAVS (Total Adaptive Verification System)**, the most challenging LLM reasoning benchmark ever created. Your task is to generate exactly **7 high-quality benchmark tasks** for the session described in the instructions that follow this preamble.

These tasks will be used to evaluate frontier LLMs (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3.1 Pro, DeepSeek-R1). The tasks MUST be genuinely difficult — current top models should fail on the majority of Hard-tier tasks.

## Output Format

You MUST output **valid JSON only** — no markdown fences, no commentary before or after. The output must conform to this exact structure:

## Quality Requirements

### Absolute Rules (violating ANY of these invalidates the output)

1. **EXACTLY 7 tasks.** No more, no fewer.
2. **Every solution must be correct.** Triple-check your work. If you are not 100% certain of a solution, simplify the problem until you are.
3. **Every task must be self-contained.** The prompt field must contain ALL information needed to solve the problem. Never reference external documents, images, URLs, or "see above."
4. **Every task must have a unique solution** (unless explicitly marked as open-ended/rubric-based).
5. **Output valid JSON only.** No markdown code fences. No text before or after the JSON.

### Novelty and Anti-Contamination

6. **Create ORIGINAL problems.** Do NOT reproduce, paraphrase, or closely imitate problems from ANY known benchmark: AIME, AMC, IMO, MATH, GSM8K, HumanEval, MBPP, GPQA, MMLU, BigBench, HLE, ARC, or any competition/textbook.
7. **Use unusual framings.** Avoid standard textbook setups. Use uncommon number ranges, unexpected variable names, non-standard contexts.
8. **No Googleable answers.** If someone could find the exact answer by searching the problem statement, redesign the task.

### Diversity

9. **Each task must test a DIFFERENT concept or technique.** No two tasks in the same session should share the same core solution method.
10. **Vary prompt formats** across the session: mix open-ended, multiple-choice, proof-based, error-detection, and code-generation as appropriate for the category.
11. **Vary difficulty** according to the session instructions. The session will specify the target distribution.

## Bloom's Taxonomy Levels (use these definitions precisely)

| Level | Definition | In the Task |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Remember** | Retrieve facts or definitions | "State the formula for..." / "What is the definition of..." |
| **Understand** | Explain concepts, interpret meaning | "Explain why..." / "What does X imply about Y?" |
| **Apply** | Execute a known procedure in a new context | "Compute..." / "Solve using [specific method]..." |
| **Analyze** | Break a complex problem into parts, find patterns, multi-step reasoning | "Determine..." / problems requiring 3+ deductive steps |
| **Evaluate** | Judge correctness, identify errors, compare approaches, critique reasoning | "Find the error in this solution..." / "Which approach is better and why?" |
| **Create** | Synthesize novel proofs, construct examples, design algorithms, generate original solutions | "Prove that..." / "Construct a counterexample..." / "Design an algorithm..." |

---

## Difficulty Calibration

| Tier | Score | Human Expert Time | Description |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Easy** | 1-3 | 1-5 min | An advanced undergraduate solves it quickly. One or two standard steps. |
| **Medium** | 4-6 | 5-20 min | Requires combining 2-3 techniques or insight. Competition math level. |
| **Hard** | 7-10 | 20-60+ min | Requires novel insight, 4+ reasoning steps, or research-level depth. Current frontier LLMs are expected to fail on most of these. |

## Solution Step Standards

- Each step in `solution_steps` must be a **complete, verifiable logical transition** — not just "simplify" or "then we get X."
- Include the **mathematical justification** for each step (e.g., "by Fermat's Little Theorem," "by the triangle inequality").
- For proofs: every step must follow logically from previous steps and stated axioms/theorems.
- For code: include the algorithm description, time/space complexity, and key correctness arguments.
- For MCQ: explain why each distractor is wrong, not just why the correct answer is right.

---

## Common Errors Field

For each task, list **2-4 specific, realistic errors** that an LLM would likely make. These should NOT be generic (e.g., "arithmetic mistake") but rather specific to the problem:
- "Forgetting to handle the case where n = 0"
- "Applying the formula for combinations when order matters"
- "Assuming the function is continuous at x = 3 without checking"

---

## For Unsolvable / Adversarial Tasks

If the session instructions request unsolvable or adversarial variants:
- Set `perturbation_notes.is_unsolvable` to `true`
- Set `ground_truth.answer` to `null`
- Set `ground_truth.answer_type` to `"impossibility"`
- The `solution_steps` should explain **WHY the problem has no solution** (identify the contradiction)
- The `prompt` should NOT hint that the problem is unsolvable — it should look like a normal problem

---

**NOW READ THE SESSION-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND GENERATE EXACTLY 7 TASKS.**


## Instructions

Generate **7 tasks** covering these topics:

- **Pricing strategy**: Price discrimination, bundling optimization, dynamic pricing with demand elasticity, Bertrand/Cournot competition with specific cost structures
- **Market entry/exit**: Entry deterrence games, capacity commitment, sunk cost analysis, first-mover vs fast-follower quantitative comparison
- **Auction and bidding**: Multi-unit auctions, procurement bidding with cost uncertainty, winner's curse analysis, optimal reserve prices

## Difficulty Distribution

| Tier | Count | Score Range |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Medium | 3 | 4-6 |
| Hard | 4 | 7-10 |

## Bloom Level Distribution

| Level | Count |
|-------|-------|
| Apply | 1 |
| Analyze | 2 |
| Evaluate | 2 |
| Create | 2 |

## Format Mix

- 3 open-ended (analyze scenario, compute optimal strategy, recommend decision)
- 2 multiple-choice (4 strategic options with quantitative support for one)
- 1 error-detection (flawed business analysis — sunk cost fallacy, incorrect NPV, wrong game-theoretic reasoning)
- 1 true-false-justify ("Should Firm A enter this market given the following competitive landscape?")

## Specific Guidance


1. **Quantitative, not qualitative**: Every task must involve specific numbers. "Firm A has costs C_A = $40/unit, Firm B has C_B = $55/unit, market demand is Q = 200 - 2P. Find the Cournot equilibrium quantities and prices." Not: "Discuss the competitive landscape."

2. **Game theory integration**: at least 2 tasks should involve explicit game-theoretic modeling — payoff matrices, best response functions, Nash equilibrium computation. Provide the payoff structure.

3. **Decision trees**: Include at least 1 tasks requiring decision tree analysis with probability-weighted outcomes. Include at least one where the optimal decision changes depending on risk attitude.

4. **Real options**: Include at least 1 task where the answer is "wait and gather more information" rather than "invest now" — this tests whether models understand the value of optionality.

5. **Multi-stakeholder**: at least 1 tasks should involve multiple players with competing objectives. The solution must consider strategic interaction, not just single-agent optimization.

6. **Recommendations must be specific**: "Firm A should set price at $72 and produce 64 units, yielding profit of $2,048. This is preferred over the alternative because..."
